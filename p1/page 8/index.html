      <p> Heart of a lion
          Fire inside me blaze like a siren
          Why would you try it?
          Wake up the beast, no, I can keep silent
          I put my time in
          Now is my time, your time is expiring
          Blood, sweat and tears, I conquered my fears
          I'm ready to fly
          We know they scared of us, know they don't care for us
          They wasn't there for us
      
      </p>
